# This program fixes the issue of the previous program.
# Now everything is inside a <while> loop.
# At the conclusion of each interview the user has
# the option to repeat the program.  
# The <while> loop makes the program repeat as long
# as the user responds with a capital 'Y'.

response = 'Y';

while response == 'Y':  # Note: Only capital 'Y' will make the loop repeat.
