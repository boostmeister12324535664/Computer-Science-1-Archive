# Nested06.py
# This program demonstrates that control structures
# can be nested with more than 2 levels.  
# This program is actually the entire previous 
# program nested inside a loop that repeats 5 times.
# NOTE: As you have more and more levels of nesting
#       indentation becomes more and more important.
# ALSO: This program does have an issue in that it
#       basically assumes you will always interview
#       exactly 5 students.
