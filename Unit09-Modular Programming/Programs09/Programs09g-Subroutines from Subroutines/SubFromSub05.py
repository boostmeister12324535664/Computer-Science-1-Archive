# SubFromSub05.py
# This program demonstrates that a function can also be 
# created from another function. In this case, the <gcf> 
# function is used to create the <lcm> function. 
# Example: LCM(A,B) = A * B / GCF(A,B)
# This program also demonstrates that you can call a 
# function if you know what it does and what parameters 
# it requires, but you do not necessarily need to know 
# how it works. This program also demonstrates how you 
# can break up a very long command and make it "wrap" 
# to the next line by using a backslash (\).
