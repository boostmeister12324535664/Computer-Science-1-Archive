# Creating a Big Graphics Program
# Step 1 - Create the "MAIN" section of the program.
# This should simply be a list of procedure calls
# and look like an outline.

# NOTE: This first step will not execute because   
#       the program is attempting to call procedures 
#       which do not exist yet.
