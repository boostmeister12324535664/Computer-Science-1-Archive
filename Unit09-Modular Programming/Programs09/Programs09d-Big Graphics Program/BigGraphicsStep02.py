# Creating a Big Graphics Program
# Step 2 - Create Stubs.
# In computer programming, a "stub" is an empty procedure.
# With the stubs in place, the program can now execute.
# Keep in mind that since the program contains nothing but
# stubs, the output will just be a blank white window.

# NOTE: Since Python requires at least one program command
#       in each procedure, we will use <pass>.  This is a
#       "null program statement" which simply does nothing.
