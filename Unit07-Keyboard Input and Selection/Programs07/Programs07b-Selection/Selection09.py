# Selection09.py
# This program demonstrates a number of things:
# 1. Selection can be based on text values also, 
#    not just number values.
# 2. As with other selection structures, Multi-Way
#    Selection can control multiple programming 
#    commands as long as proper, consistent 
#    indentation is used.
# 3. The program will not work properly if the 
#    user does not enter an A, B, C, D or F.
