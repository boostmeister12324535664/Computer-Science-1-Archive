# Selection06.py
# This program is supposed to display the letter grade
# earned based on the number grade entered by the user.
# Since there are more than 2 possible paths (A,B,C,D,F)
# this would be an example of "Multi-Way Selection"...
# if the program worked; however, using 5 separate <if> 
# statements has created a Logic Error with strange output.
