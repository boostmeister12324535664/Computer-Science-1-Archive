# Selection11.py
# This program has 2 separate <if..else> structures.
# The first determines if a student is admitted to
# the college based on his/her SAT score.
# The second determines is that student qualifies
# for financial aid based on his/her family income.
# The problem with this program is that even if the  
# student is not admitted, it still asks about family 
# income and has the potential of telling a student who 
# was not admitted that he/she qualifies for financial aid.
