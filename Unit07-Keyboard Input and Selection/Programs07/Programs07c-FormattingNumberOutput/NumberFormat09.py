# NumberFormat09.py
# This program demonstrates how to format real number
# output with the <format> command.  The f inside 
# "{:6.2f}" means this is a "floating-point number"
# which is the same thing as a "real number".  
# The 6 indicates the entire number will be 6 characters
# long, including the decimal point.  The 2 indicates
# there will be 2 digits after the decimal point.
